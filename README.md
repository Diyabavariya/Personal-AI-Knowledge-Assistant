# Personal AI Knowledge Assistant

A Python-based AI knowledge assistant that allows users to upload documents and ask natural language questions through a web interface. The system processes document content and retrieves relevant information to generate context-aware answers using natural language processing and information retrieval techniques.

## Features

- Web interface for document upload and querying  
- Text preprocessing and normalization  
- Chunk-based document representation  
- Semantic similarity–based information retrieval  
- Context-aware answer generation  
- Modular and maintainable code structure

## System Design

The application is organized into logical components:

- **Application Layer**  
  Manages application initialization and request handling.

- **Document Ingestion**  
  Loads and cleans document content for processing.

- **Query Processing**  
  Interprets user queries for retrieval.

- **Retrieval Engine**  
  Matches user queries with relevant document segments.

- **Answer Construction**  
  Produces concise and relevant responses.

- **Frontend Interface**  
  Provides a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
